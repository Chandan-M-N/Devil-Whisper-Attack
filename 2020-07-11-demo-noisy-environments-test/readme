On July 11, 2020, we evaluated some AEs in noisy environments and they worked. At the same time as playing the AEs, we used another computer to play a video of a volleyball game. The success rate of AE (SRoA) for three commands (“OK Google, navigate to my home”, “OK Google, turn off the light” and “Hey Cortana, make it warmer”) are 4/10, 5/10, and 7/10, respectively.
